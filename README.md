This project explores the application of autoencoder architectures for anomaly detection using real-world traffic data. The dataset, "occupancy_6005.csv", comprises 2380 rows with timestamp and real traffic value features. After preprocessing and exploratory data analysis, four autoencoder architectures—Standard, LSTM, Fully Connected, and Sequential—are built and evaluated. Training, validation, and testing phases monitor loss versus epoch count, with the best-performing model's weights saved. Strengths and limitations of using autoencoders for anomaly detection are discussed, offering insights for future research and practical implementations.
